        <P>The principle of proximity calls for related items to be grouped visually, 
            creating less clutter and making for a more organized layout. 
            Items unrelated to each other should be placed further apart, 
            to emphasize their lack of relationship. There proper white space, visual hierarchy, and
            there is clarity and legibility.

            <p>A substantial fort was built by Denmark-Norway in the 1660s, thereafter the fort changed ownership between Denmark-Norway, Portugal, the Akwamu, Britain, and finally post-Independence Ghana. 
                Under Denmark–Norway control it was the capital of the Danish Gold Coast, and held and dispatched enslaved people overseas.
                In 1902, Osu Castle became the seat of government in Ghana but this has now moved to Golden Jubilee House.
                Because of its testimony to European colonial influence in West Africa and the Atlantic slave trade, 
                the castle was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979 along with several other castles and forts in Ghana.</p>

            <p>It is dedicated to the prominent Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah. 
                The memorial complex was dedicated in 1992, and is situated on the site of the former British colonial polo grounds in Accra.
                It is five acres in size.The mausoleum, designed by Don Arthur, houses the bodies of Kwame Nkrumah and his wife Fathia Nkrumah.
                It is the spot where Nkrumah made the declaration of Ghana's independence. 
                On the premises is a museum that has on display objects from various stages of his life.The building is meant to represent an upside down sword, which in Akan culture is a symbol of peace.
                The mausoleum is clad from top to bottom with Italian marble, with a black star at its apex to symbolize unity. The interior boasts marble flooring and a mini mastaba looking marble grave marker, surrounded by river-washed rocks. 
                A skylight at the top in the mausoleum illuminates the grave. The mausoleum is surrounded by water, a symbol of life.</p>

            <p>The Flagstaff House was reconstructed and inaugurated by the government of John Agyekum Kufour with the name Golden Jubilee House in November 2008 when construction was about 70%–80% completed.
                In January 2009, the incoming government of President John Atta Mills moved the office of the president back to Osu Castle and later changed the sign in front of the building back to its original name claiming that the previous government had not used a Legislative Instrument to effect the change as required by law.
                The Mills government was in turn criticized that the name Flagstaff House which was given to the building by the British Gold Coast government glorifies Ghana's Gold Coast past. 
                The seat of government was moved back to Flagstaff House in January 2013 by John Dramani Mahama.</p>

            <p>Located directly east of the Korle Lagoon, Jamestown and Usshertown are the oldest districts of Accra, Ghana[1] and emerged as communities around the 17th century British James Fort and Dutch Ussher Fort on the Gulf of Guinea coast.
                These districts were developed at the end of the 19th century, and following the rapid growth of the city during the 20th century, they became areas of a dense mixture of commercial and residential use.
                Today, both Jamestown and Usshertown remain fishing communities inhabited primarily by the Ga. Although in a state of decay, the districts are significant in the history of Accra, which replaced Cape Coast as the capital of Gold Coast (British colony) in 1876. 
                The original lighthouse, built at James Fort in 1871, was replaced in the 1930s by the current tower, which is 28 m (92 ft) tall. The lighthouse, which is 34 metres (112 ft) above sea level, has a visibility of 16 nautical miles (30 km),it overlooks the harbour, James Fort, the Bukom district and Ussher Fort.</p>
